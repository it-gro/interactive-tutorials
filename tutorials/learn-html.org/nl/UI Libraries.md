Tutorial
--------

Over the years, many CSS & JavaScript libraries have been introduced. The CSS libraries ease the process of creating a 
beautiful website with little effort, and requires only very basic CSS knowledge to use. Since mastering CSS is a very
hard task, the libraries enabled millions of developers to start creating websites easily, without previous knowledge
in designing websites at all.

Here are a few examples of CSS libraries that were recently introduced and are ranking high on Google:

* Bootstrap, by Twitter ([[http://getbootstrap.com/]])
* Foundation, by Zurb ([[http://foundation.zurb.com/]])
* Pure CSS, by Yahoo ([[http://purecss.io/]])
* Bulma (based on the new CSS3 Flexbox specification - [[http://bulma.io/]])
* Skeleton ([[http://getskeleton.com/]])
* Semantic UI ([[http://semantic-ui.com/]])
